##  Featured Projects

### 1. Keyword-based News Recommendation System
- **Overview**: Extracts keywords using KeyBERT, expands them with Word2Vec, filters summaries via TF-IDF, and personalizes recommendations using user behavior and decay-weighted keyword scoring. K-means clustering enhances content diversity.
- **Tech Stack**: Python Â· Flask Â· SQL/NoSQL Â· KeyBERT Â· Word2Vec Â· TF-IDF Â· K-means
- **Highlights**: Streamlined news summarization and personalized delivery based on user interaction patterns.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
- **Overview**: Engineered a RAG pipeline with LangChain and FAISS for vector-based information retrieval, integrated diverse retrievers and a reranker, and benchmarked LLMs (e.g., Falcon-7B, gemma-2-2b) for response fluency and relevance.
- **Tech Stack**: Python Â· LangChain Â· FAISS Â· Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Highlights**: Enhanced LLM accuracy and relevance through optimized retrieval strategies and reranking.

### 3. Campus Tour Chatbot (Internship Project)
- **Overview**: Developed an interactive campus tour chatbot, leveraging Java Spring Boot for backend APIs, BERT embeddings for text representation, and logistic regression for personalized recommendations.
- **Tech Stack**: Java Spring Boot Â· Python Â· PyTorch (BERT) Â· scikit-learn
- **Highlights**: Delivered a dynamic and personalized user experience using advanced NLP and ML models.
